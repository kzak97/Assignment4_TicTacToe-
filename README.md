# Assignment4_TicTacToe-
Dear Sir, In my game "O" stands for player1 and "X" for player2. Therfore, I did not found it neccessary to add a jTextField showing my name. I have used a container having a GridLayout of 3x3 with JButtons as its components. Futhermore, I have added checks:  Once the game is over, no one will be able to take additional turns. No more than one turns on one single box.
