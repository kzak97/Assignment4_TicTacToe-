# Assignment4_TicTacToe-
Dear Sir, In my game "O" stands for player1 and "X" for player2. I have used a container having a GridLayout of 3x3 with JButtons as its components.

Futhermore, I have added checks:  

Once the game is over, no one will be able to take additional turns.

No more than one turns on one single box.
